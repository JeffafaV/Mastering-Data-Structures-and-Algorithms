# Mastering-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
This holds all the code that I implemented in the Mastering Data Structures 
& Algorithms Using C & C++ course on Udemy:
https://www.udemy.com/course/datastructurescncpp/
All code is broken into their dedicated section similar to how the course 
is structured. Each file name is the name of the video in the course that 
implements the program. This is mainly for me to study and practice data 
structures as well as C programming.
